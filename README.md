# Word Prediction Model 
## Course Project

The following project is part of a [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) in which the goal was to create a word prediction model that takes in a word or a phrase as input and predicts a set of next possible word with their probabilities. 

It is based on a simple NLP NGram predictive modelling approach with GT smoothing using R, RStudio and Shiny App.
